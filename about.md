# About Me

I’ve been gaming for as long as I can remember. Started out on console, then got my first PC in 2010—but it could barely run Call of Duty 1.1 (and honestly, even that was pushing it). Still, I stuck with it, and by 2015, I was lucky enough to get picked up by a pro team. That kicked off nearly a decade of competing, traveling, and chasing wins in the esports world.

Around the same time, I started my Bachelor's in Mechatronics Engineering. It sounded cool, and it really was—there’s a bit of everything in it, and that mix kept me curious. In 2019, I took a two-year break from school to go all-in on esports and move to Georgia, USA. Things didn’t go as planned, so I headed back home and finished my degree.

While in school, I took a computer vision course that completely changed the game for me. It made me want to explore how machines “see” the world, and that pulled me into AI. I wasn’t a strong coder back then, so I doubled down on Python and picked up a job at a local pharmacy doing analytics and building their data systems.

In 2022 and 2023, I spent most of my time self-studying and prepping for a shift into ML/AI. I went through the DeepLearning.ai and Stanford ML courses, plus some great tracks on 365DataScience. That’s also when I got into AWS, earning a couple of certifications and learning how to actually deploy models and not just build them.

Eventually, I interned at FlairsTech and stayed on for a year, working on real-world ML projects that helped people and scaled well. After that, I got married, moved to the US, and started my Master’s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. These days, I’m working as a service desk analyst while I focus on my studies and keep growing in AI.

I still stream for fun sometimes, just to stay in touch with friends and the gaming community. Between esports, engineering, and AI, I’ve always just followed what I’m passionate about. And that’s what keeps pushing me forward.
