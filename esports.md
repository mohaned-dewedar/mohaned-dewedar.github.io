# Esports

I spent a decade competing and analyzing at a high level, including two World Championship wins—one as a player, and one as a coach. It’s been a wild ride full of strategy, growth, and some unforgettable moments. I only wish I could do it all over again.

## Highlights
<ul>
  <li>🏆 Won Mid-Season Invitational as a player (2019)</li>
  <li>🏆 Won Smite World Championship as a coach (Jan 2024)</li>
  <li>🏆 Won Smite World Championship as a player (Jan 2025)</li>
</ul>

## Analytics Work as a Coach

I built scouting and performance dashboards in **Power BI** and **Excel** to break down matchups, spot trends, and optimize team strategy. These tools helped guide preparation, draft decisions, and mid-season adjustments throughout the years. I wish the Smite API was more accessible but collecting all this data from scratch stopped me from creating crazy ML solutions. Just some simple W/L predictors and win probability models based on team stats and compositions.


## Twitch

You can occasionally catch me live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/thecherryo) where I stream games ,mainly smite and Chess , chat with the community, and sometimes go do some fun project building.
