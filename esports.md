# Esports

I spent a decade competing and analyzing at a high level, including two World Championship wins—one as a player, and one as a coach. It’s been a wild ride full of strategy, growth, and some unforgettable moments. I only wish I could do it all over again.

## Analytics Work as a Coach

I  developed scouting and performance dashboards in **Power BI** and **Excel** to analyze matchups, track trends, and refine team strategy.

These tools informed draft decisions, guided mid-season adjustments, and contributed to championship-level preparation. While the Smite API’s limitations prevented deeper machine learning applications, I built win–loss predictors and win probability models from manually collected data.

## Twitch

You can occasionally catch me live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/thecherryo) where I stream games ,mainly smite and Chess , chat with the community, and sometimes go do some fun project building.
