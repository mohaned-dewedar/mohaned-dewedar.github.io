## ðŸ”„ Machine Learning for Trading (ML4T)

- **Martingale Strategy**
  - Simulate American roulette to study statistical outcomes.
  - Focus: statistics, experimentation, plotting, reporting.

- **Portfolio Optimization**
  - Use `scipy.optimize` to create optimal stock portfolios.
  - Skills: financial data wrangling, constraints modeling.

- **Assess Learners**
  - Implement decision trees, random forests, and bagging.
  - Compare overfitting, underfitting, and learner behavior.

- **Defeat Learners**
  - Design datasets to "break" learners like linear regression vs trees.

- **Market Simulator**
  - Create a simulator that handles trades and computes portfolio performance.

- **Indicator Evaluation**
  - Evaluate technical indicators (SMA, BBP) and build a theoretical strategy.

- **Q-Learning Robot**
  - Use RL to navigate environments (used mainly for skill dev).

- **Strategy Evaluation**
  - Build rule-based and ML-based trading strategies and compare performance.
